# State-of-the-Art (SOTA) in LLM Creation

The state of the art (SOTA or SoTA), sometimes referred to as cutting edge, leading edge, or bleeding edge, refers to the highest level of general development.

### Key Dimensions of SOTA LLM Creation

Creating a state-of-the-art LLM involves a multi-dimensional approach, covering a wide range of problems, languages, and prompting techniques. A comprehensive creation process might include:

-   **800 programming problems:** A diverse set of challenges to test the model's problem-solving and code generation capabilities.
-   **Three programming languages:** To ensure the model is not language-specific and can handle a variety of syntaxes and paradigms.
-   **Six LLMs:** As a baseline for comparison and to leverage the strengths of different architectures.
-   **Three usage scenarios:** To evaluate the model's performance in real-world applications, such as code completion, debugging, and code generation from natural language.
-   **Three prompting techniques:** To test the model's ability to respond to different types of prompts, such as zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot learning.
